        <li>We use the Google Sheets API to make updates or read from your spreadsheet (e.g. adding data or inserting a pivot table)</li>
        <li>We use external requests to send and retrieve data that is not contained within your Google account (e.g. accessing an external API to get data, calling functions from our own servers, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="section-header"><strong>Data from your Database</strong></p>
    <p>DbConnector does not store or share data from your database (i.e. rows and columns). We do use error messages returned from your database 
    to provide accurate error reporting to users. We store metadata such as the number of rows returned by a query and how long a query takes to 
    run in order to ensure our servers have capacity to handle the demand of our users.
